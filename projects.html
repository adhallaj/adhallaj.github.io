				<p>Melanophore is a design that draws direct inspiration from chromatophores, specialized cells that expand/retract to show/hide pigments. In animals, chromatophores are often used as camoflauge or as a defense mechanism. This design replicates the mechanical function of melanophores (chromatophores that use melanin) for a variety of uses including camoflauge, surface augmentation, sunlight absorption or reflection, and communication.</p>

					<p>The first prototype is made out of string, canvas, and fishing line. The string can be expanded across the surface of the canvas, or retracted towards the center to mimic the melanophores found in fish.</p>

					<p>For the future of this project, I'd like to experiment with new materials and mechanisms, eventually quilting together many "cells" into an versatile surface. Imagine a room with gently shifting patterns on the walls. A window with a tint that slowly fades to transparency. A house with a surface that adjusts its tone based on how much sunlight needs to be absorbed.</p>

				<p>One of the central differences between artificial intelligence and natural intelligence is the ability to experience emotion. The Emma Project explores the boundary between the artificial and the natural. Emma is a Python script; a very simple AI designed to replicate emotional patterns based off of a real humans experience. Emma was given 365 data points, the days of the year. Each data point was the main emotion, Happy/Neutral/Sad, that the individual was feeling that day. Using this data, Emma generated a markov matrix: a table that quantifies the likelihood of change between one state (emotion) to another.</p>

				<h1>Markov matrix generated by Emma</h1>

				<p>Another way of looking at this matrix is with arrows. In the diagram below the three emotions are placed in a triangle. Each arrow that points from one emotion to another is the likelihood of change in that direction. So if Emma is "happy" one day, the likelihood of it being "happy" the next day is 0.5, the likelihood of it being "neutral" the next day is 0.3, and the likelihood of it being "sad" the next day is 0.2.</p>

				<p>So, the AI has adopted the individual's tendency to switch between emotions and an interesting pattern emerges. Emma is more likely to stay "happy" or "sad" than change emotions, and is equally likely to stay "neutral" or go from "neutral" to "happy". This is only a simple reflection of complex emotional habits; there are so many external variables that can influence these patterns. Despite its limits, it raises some question about mental health and what it means to be "depressed" vs. "happy" as a person. <br> <br>In the future I'll program Emma to create a markov chain and generate it's own year of emotions and see if it's overall a more "happy" AI as expected. I'd also like to install a "face" to display emotions; something simple like an LED panel with a dynamic happy/neutral/sad face. It would also be very interesting to collect data from other volunteers and generate more AI's to observe emotional patterns across individuals.<br><br> To what extent can we explore what it is to feel human, in the form of a dynamic pattern?</p>
